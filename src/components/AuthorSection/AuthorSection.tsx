      Hi, Iâ€™m Ara Manz, an entrepreneur and a blessed father of three
      amazing boys. After nearly a decade in corporate IT management, I felt
      like I was just going through the motions. Everything changed in 2018
      when I decided to pursue financial freedom and build something I truly
      care about. With experience across seven industries and successful
      businesses from construction to digital marketing and e-commerce, I&apos;m
      passionate about helping everyday people like you. I teach <b className="font-bold text-white">the
      action-by-action</b> system you need to <b className="font-bold text-white">build a successful online
      business.</b> In this program, I remove the guesswork from your path,
      equipping you with an actionable system to start and grow a profitable
      online business. From idea research and validation to crafting offers
      and pricing, from first sales to scaling your business&apos;I&apos;ve got you
      covered. The result? You get to pursue your passion, building the
      business you&apos;ve always dreamed of.
